## Project Scope & Methodology

### Business Problem
How do housing features and neighborhood amenities impact family-oriented household expenditures in Singapore, particularly in the context of declining Total Fertility Rate (TFR = 0.97 in 2024)?

### Target Stakeholders
- Policymakers (HDB, Ministry of Social and Family Development)
- Real estate developers
- Urban planning authorities (URA)

### Key Hypothesis
Households with greater access to family-friendly amenities exhibit higher family-oriented expenditures, even after controlling for income and flat size.

### Novel Contributions
1. **Data Innovation**: Ecological inference technique combining HES 2023 and Census 2020
2. **LLM Integration**: Automated expenditure categorization and insight generation
3. **Policy Focus**: Amenity optimization for family investment support
