- [x] **CHK-017**: Academic rigor metrics enforce limitations disclosure and assumption validation
  - ✅ SC-022 to SC-024: Limitations explicit, diagnostics documented, codebook references

### Assumptions & Dependencies

- [x] **CHK-018**: Assumptions section categorized (Data, Technical, Methodological) with 10 items
  - ✅ 10 assumptions: WVS completeness, Q274 validity, MAR missingness, Python 3.8+, API keys, cross-sectional validity, etc.
  
- [x] **CHK-019**: Dependencies section separates internal (constitution, proposal) vs external (data, libraries, tools)
  - ✅ 4 internal deps (constitution, proposal, data, directory), 3 external categories (data sources, Python libs, dev tools)
  
- [x] **CHK-020**: Python library versions specified with minimum requirements
  - ✅ 11 libraries with versions: pandas ≥1.3.0, scikit-learn ≥1.0.0, statsmodels ≥0.13.0, etc.
  
- [x] **CHK-021**: Academic dependencies reference critical documentation (WVS codebook, IS5126 rubric)
  - ✅ 3 academic deps: Codebook, rubric, statistical theory

### Scope Boundaries

- [x] **CHK-022**: Out of Scope section explicitly excludes 7 advanced techniques beyond project scope
  - ✅ Excluded: causal inference, longitudinal, deep learning, production, hierarchical models, weighting, HES mandatory
  
- [x] **CHK-023**: Future Considerations listed (6 items) to prevent scope creep during implementation
  - ✅ Listed: real-time data, mobile app, multi-language, advanced features, external validation, policy simulation
  
- [x] **CHK-024**: Boundaries clarify IS5126 focus, timeline constraints, resource limitations
  - ✅ 3 boundary statements: course deliverables priority, semester timeline, standard computing

## Content Quality

### Clarity & Precision

- [x] **CHK-025**: No placeholder text ([FEATURE NAME], [DATE], [BRIEF TITLE]) remaining in document
  - ✅ All placeholders replaced with specific content
  
- [x] **CHK-026**: No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers (specification is self-contained with informed assumptions)
  - ✅ grep_search confirmed zero clarification markers
  
- [x] **CHK-027**: Technical terms (Q-codes, Poisson, LASSO, FastAPI) used correctly and consistently
  - ✅ All terms align with WVS documentation and standard ML/stats terminology
  
- [x] **CHK-028**: Cross-references valid (links to constitution, proposal, rubric documents exist in workspace)
  - ✅ References: `.specify/memory/constitution.md`, `Docs/refined_proposal.md`, `Docs/final_group_project_2025.txt`

### Alignment

  - ✅ Principle I (Reproducibility): FR-010, SC-010-013
  - ✅ Principle II (Simplicity): User Story 2 priority, baseline models emphasis
  - ✅ Principle III (Data Quality): FR-005, SC-001-004
  - ✅ Principle IV (Limitations): SC-022, edge cases documented
  - ✅ Principle V (Modularity): FR-028, notebook structure
  
- [x] **CHK-030**: Requirements support refined proposal objectives (Singapore fertility drivers, LLM integration, policy insights)
  - ✅ User Stories 1-5 map to proposal sections: data pipeline, interpretable models, validation, LLM prototype, deliverables

## Feature Readiness Assessment

### Can implementation begin? **YES ✅**

**Justification**:
1. All mandatory spec sections complete (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria, Assumptions, Dependencies, Out of Scope)
2. Zero clarification markers - no blocking questions for stakeholders
3. Requirements prioritized and testable independently (P1 data pipeline can start immediately)
4. Success criteria provide clear acceptance tests for validation
5. Dependencies identified with version specifications for environment setup
6. Constitution compliance validated across all principles

**Recommended Next Steps**:
1. Proceed to `/speckit.plan` to generate implementation plan with phase structure
2. Create Phase 0 (Research) for WVS data exploration and environment setup
3. Create Phase 1 (Design) for pipeline architecture and notebook structure
4. Create Phase 2 (Tasks) for actionable work items from FR-001 to FR-030
5. Begin implementation with P1 user story (Reproducible Data Pipeline)

**Risk Assessment**: LOW
- No external blockers (data source known, libraries standard)
- Scope well-bounded (out-of-scope section comprehensive)
- Academic context reduces production deployment complexity
- Fallback strategies documented for edge cases (HES failure, small sample, convergence issues)
